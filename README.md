# Circulate Hashed Data Collection for Node.js

This is a library to aid in the implementation of [Circulate](http://www.circulate.com) hashed data colection. This library hashes data and sends it to the Circulate API, which then returns content to be placed on a webpage or in an email for ad tracking.

More details about the Circulate API can be found here: [https://portal.circulate.com/portal/help/dapi/implement-hashed](https://portal.circulate.com/portal/help/dapi/implement-hashed)
